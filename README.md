# Killer-Saucers
Static screen arcade shoot 'em up for the Commodore 64

Killer Saucers is a hi-score attack shoot 'em up which contains eight levels. This game was started during Autumn 2020 as part of a "Commodore Format" 30th Anniversary theC64 game programming challenge. The challenge failed due to a wrong assembler used, and was later transfered to work in ACME/C64Studio format. 

# What's the game all about?

You control a futuristic mobile missile launcher, which has to save the city from alien invaders.... The Killer Saucers. Your task is to shoot a limited number of saucers, whilst avoiding running out of all of your missiles. Beware, some of the aliens have built in trackers. If they track your ship, they will attempt to kamikaze into you. Some saucers will also drop bombs. If you complete your quota, without losing all of your ammo, a bonus is awarded based on the amount of ammmo you have saved. Lives are lost if a saucer, a bomb hits the launcher or you run out of missiles. Can you get through all 8 levels and save your city?
